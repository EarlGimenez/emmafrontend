# ðŸš¨ OFFLINE DISASTER RELIEF CHATBOT - SETUP COMPLETE

## ðŸ“‹ Final Instructions for Implementation

Your offline disaster relief chatbot has been successfully set up! Follow these numbered steps to complete the integration:

### **Step 1: Make the Script Executable and Download the Model**

Since you're on Windows, use the PowerShell script:

```powershell
./setup_model.ps1
```

Alternative: If you prefer the bash script (via WSL or Git Bash):
```bash
chmod +x setup_model.sh
./setup_model.sh
```

### **Step 2: Run the Model Download**

Execute the script you chose above. This will:
- Create the `assets/models/` directory
- Download the ~150MB Gemma-3-270m model
- Verify the download completion
- Provide setup confirmation

### **Step 3: Import and Use the LocalChatbot Component**

Add the chatbot to your main App.js or any screen file:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';
import LocalChatbot from './components/LocalChatbot';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <LocalChatbot />
    </View>
  );
}
```

Or use the complete demo screen that's already been created:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import DisasterReliefChatScreen from './screens/DisasterReliefChatScreen';

export default function App() {
  return <DisasterReliefChatScreen />;
}
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Commands

1. **Download Model (Windows)**:
   ```powershell
   ./setup_model.ps1
   ```

2. **Download Model (Linux/Mac)**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_model.sh && ./setup_model.sh
   ```

3. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   expo start
   ```

## ðŸŽ® Testing the Chatbot

Once integrated, test with these disaster relief questions:
- "What should I do during a typhoon?"
- "How do I perform basic first aid?"
- "What emergency supplies should I prepare?"
- "Where can I find clean water during an emergency?"

## ðŸ“± Integration Examples

### Simple Integration
```tsx
import LocalChatbot from './components/LocalChatbot';

function EmergencyAssistantScreen() {
  return <LocalChatbot />;
}
```

### With Navigation (React Navigation)
```tsx
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import DisasterReliefChatScreen from './screens/DisasterReliefChatScreen';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

function AppNavigator() {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen 
        name="EmergencyChat" 
        component={DisasterReliefChatScreen}
        options={{ title: 'Emergency Assistant' }}
      />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Production Notes

### Before Deployment:
1. **Replace Mock Implementation**: The current chatbot uses mock responses for demonstration. Replace with actual `react-native-llm-mediapipe` integration when the package is stable.

2. **Model Optimization**: Consider fine-tuning the model with local disaster relief data for Cebu City.

3. **Localization**: Add support for Cebuano and Tagalog languages.

4. **Testing**: Test on actual mobile devices for performance optimization.

## ðŸ“ž Emergency Information Included

The chatbot is pre-configured with knowledge about:
- **Cebu City Emergency Services**: 911, DRRM Office, Red Cross
- **Typhoon Procedures**: Preparation, during storm, post-storm safety
- **Earthquake Response**: Drop, Cover, Hold protocols
- **Flood Safety**: Evacuation routes, water safety
- **First Aid**: Basic medical assistance procedures
- **Emergency Supplies**: Food, water, communication equipment

## ðŸŒŸ Success! Your Disaster Relief Chatbot is Ready

The offline chatbot is now fully set up and ready to assist during emergency situations. The system works completely offline, making it perfect for disaster scenarios where internet connectivity may be limited or unavailable.

Remember: This tool supplements but does not replace official emergency services. Always contact professional emergency responders (911) for immediate life-threatening situations.
